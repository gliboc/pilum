Right now this tool allows to parse files or enter interactively
rewriting systems with rules of the form `expr â†’ expr`.

The directory `exos` contains a few examples of such systems.

## Usage 

There is a pre-compiled linux executable `main.exe` which 
can be run as `./main.exe <filename>` or `./main.exe` in order to 
either load an example file or try the REPL.

The normal way to build this executable is by using [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) with
the commands `dune build ./main.exe` and `dune exec ./main.exe`
(with, or without arguments)
